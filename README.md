# Majixed's Vim dotfiles

Here is a collection of my Vim dotfiles

## How to use

Simply clone this repository into your `.vim` folder, then create your `.vimrc` file in your home directory containing only this line,
```vim
runtime vimrc
```
For example, you can do,
```bash
$ echo "runtime vimrc" > ~/.vimrc
```
You may replace `~/` with the path of your home directory. Alternatively you can move the `vimrc` file from your `.vim` directory into your home directory and rename it to `.vimrc`.

Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions.
